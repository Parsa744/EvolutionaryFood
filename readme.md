This project is a small attempt to create an evolutionary tree of dishes. The benefits of this approach are, first, to learn how to cook more efficiently and pass this knowledge to future generations, and second, to gain a deeper understanding of culinary traditions as a cultural phenomenon. Currently, the focus is on Iranian dishes, but of course, we welcome all cuisines!
